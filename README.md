# Assignments_ML_Coursera_Andrew_Ng

This repo contains the completed assignments of the ML Coursera course by Andrew Ng. 
The assignments were commented and partially set up by the organizers. I completed the 
missing parts as explained in the .pdf files contained in the machine-learning-ex* folders.
All the code is in Matlab/Octave.
