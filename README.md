# Assignments ML Coursera Andrew Ng

This repo contains the completed assignments of the [ML Coursera course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/U6HLAFFKDMMA). 
The assignments were commented and partially set up by the organizers. I completed the 
missing parts as explained in the .pdf files contained in the machine-learning-ex* folders.
All the code is in Matlab/Octave.
